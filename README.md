# hackIIITD

We have built a discussion forum using Discourse in which we analyze the user's post and comments that we run throug a trained NLP model built using NLTK which gives us a score of the likeliness of the person having depression (<-0.8) and a tag which tells about the status of the likeliness of anxiety.

We have hosted our forum on Digital Ocean at http://techwalkers.tech.
